# Welcome to Open Weight Database

Hello there, and welcome on the OWD GitHub repository! To see the item already present in the database, [go to the website!](https://openweightdatabase.org/)

## What's the point?

Every hiker/alpinist/adventurer knows how long it can be to weight every item when preparing a trip. The goal of this project is to make an inventory of outdoor gear with their corresponding weight. A good and easy way to find all you need, to without having to take out the scale and reweigh everything before every trip!
