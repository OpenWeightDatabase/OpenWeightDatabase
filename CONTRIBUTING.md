# Contributing to OWD

## Before contributing...

Here are some basic rules to follow in order to contribute to the project:

* Only share items **you weighted yourself!** By doing so, we can ensure that the weight is accurate.
* For electronic devices, weight them **without batteries** when possible. 

## How to contribute

### I have a GitHub account

Great, it will be easy for you! You can either:

* Open a PR with your contribution;
* Use one of the two forms available in the [issues creation menu](https://github.com/OpenWeightDatabase/OpenWeightDatabase/issues/new/choose).

### I do not have a GitHub account

If you do not have a GitHub account, you can send me an email to `owd@plop.name` with the following informations:

* Catgeory (sleeping bags, climbing shoes...)
* Brand
* Model
* Weight (in grams)
* Size (if wearable)

## Thanks again! :heart:
