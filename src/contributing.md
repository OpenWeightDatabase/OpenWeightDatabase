# Contributing

Having an inventory that accuartely covers most of the outdoor equipment is a really ambitious project. That's why every contribution is more than welcomed.

You can contribute to this project by either:

* adding new items;
* reporting incorrect items in the database.

The procedure to contribute, as well as the contribution rules, are detailed in the [dedicated page in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenWeightDatabase/OpenWeightDatabase/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Thanks ❤️
