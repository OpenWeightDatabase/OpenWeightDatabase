# Exporting the data

As all the data is stored in CSV files, it can be easily exported. You can find the CSV files in the Github repository, [just here](https://github.com/OpenWeightDatabase/OpenWeightDatabase/tree/main/db).

It should be fairly easy to download them and process them the way you want. Enjoy!
