Hello there, and welcome on the Open Weight Database website!

## What's the point?

Every hiker/alpinist/adventurer knows how long it can be to weight every item when preparing a trip. The goal of this website is to make an inventory of outdoor gear with their corresponding weight. A good and easy way to find all you need, to without having to take out the scale and reweigh everything before every trip!

## Getting started

Use the navigation column on the left to navigate to a given category, or use the magnifying glass on the top to search for an item.
